# CodeFellowship

This app allows students at Code Fellows to connect with each other and support each other on their coding joureys. Students can register on the app, which creates for them a profile where they can add posts, and grants them access to view other user's profiles.


To run this app:
  *Ensure you have postgreSQL installed on your computer.
  *Clone this repo.
  *Modify the application.properties file to use the correct databaseURL, name, and password. Create a new database on your machine if necessary.
  *Run `./gradlew bootRun`. This will start a local server on port 8080 which you can view in your browser on http://localhost:8080/
